When I started to feel a bit comfortable with CSS and scratched the surface of JavaScript, I wanted to take on a challenging project. 
And by challenging, I mean one that would keep me on my toes and one I wouldn't have step-by-step guidance for.

The idea came to me a while back when I just started messing around with CSS. Div borders, if made bold enough, can resemble old-fashioned LED clocks. 
I also bet I'm not the first one who saw that; it's quite a generic idea.

However, it was my first project of that scale, and even though my code is a mess that makes me embarrassed, I'm still happy with the design. The three strong features I love about it are:

  1. I have managed to find a perfect type for am/pm
  2. The analogous colors work very well with the subtle drop shadow which brings an additional dimention.
  3. Phi ratio makes the digits pleasant to look at eventhow it's just a bunch of CSS borders
